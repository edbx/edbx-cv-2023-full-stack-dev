        I possess a strong technical skill set that includes expertise in
        various programming languages such as JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, and
        CSS3, enabling me to develop dynamic and interactive web applications. I
        am well-versed in popular frameworks and libraries like React, Node.js,
        and Express.js, empowering me to build robust and scalable front-end
        solutions. With proficiency in version control systems like Git and
        GitHub, I am adept at managing code repositories and facilitating
        seamless collaboration within development teams. I am experienced in
        Agile methodologies, particularly Scrum, which allows me to work
        efficiently and deliver projects on time. Additionally, I am familiar
        with essential tools like Webpack, Babel, and ESLint, ensuring code
        optimization and maintainability. I have a strong understanding of
        testing frameworks like Jest and Enzyme, enabling me to implement
        comprehensive test suites for reliable code. Furthermore, my knowledge
        of responsive design principles and UI/UX principles allows me to create
        visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces. I have worked with
        MongoDB as a database solution and possess proficiency in handling
        RESTful APIs, JSON, AJAX, and npm for seamless data integration and
        communication.
